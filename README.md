# .dotfiles

## Usage

The easiest way to use this repository is to clone it and then run the install.sh script of the desired application (e.g. run <path_to_repository>/vim/install.sh to apply the vim configuration).
The install.sh-scripts will always create a symbolic link to the configuration files inside the repository, so updating the repository will also update the configurations on your machine.
